Shyft is a cross-platform open
toolbox developed at Statkraft in cooperation
with the Department of Geosciences at the
University of Oslo.

The overall goal for the toolbox is to provide
python-enabled high performance components with
operational quality. This includes (but not
limited to) the features listed below:

- Well-designed components and algorithms aiming
at speed, robustness and scalability

- Using well known high performance open-source
3rd party libraries

- Using C++ as primary core language, python as
cooperative and orchestration tool

- Unit-tests, integration tests, examples and
demo, high code coverage

- Continuous build-test-deploy on many platforms
(linux,windows, even raspberry pi/arm is possible)

- Integrated issue tracking, merge-requests,
allowing everyone to contribute
- Completely transparent and open available
source-code
- Supports in-house private build-systems for
those that would like to extend and integrate
with in-house software products

This allows model experts in the business
domain, scientists at institutes/universities
together with professional programmers can
cooperate efficiently to maximize the IT-
support in the energy-market domain. Once
improved functionality is implemented and properly
tested, it can be released for use.

Shyft has rolling-releases - improvements are
shipped as soon as testing proves the improvement
and quality. The Shyft software components are
used in active 24x7 operation at Statkraft and are
actively maintained and developed. Some of our
tools and libraries will work nice for other
domains as well, like the time-series package.
